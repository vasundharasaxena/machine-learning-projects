# Final-Year-Project__Bot-Detection-on-Twitter
We have implemented the machine learning algorithms of algorithms such as Na¨ıve
Bayes Classifying algorithm, Clustering Classifier, Decision Tree, Hybrid Classifier, and
various other custom algorithms based on what is required. The primary goal is to detect
bot accounts on social media platforms using a variety of big data mining tools. The
aim is to take a random set of user accounts from a social media platform and to filter
out the bot accounts using machine learning algorithms. Word Embedding techniques
using Python are also carried out to find the similarities between tweets of bot accounts
to classify them as non-legitimate. The experimentation is performed on a labelled data
set collected from Kaggle (Jain, 2019) to check the accuracy of the proposed model.
The following are the different stages of our model:
1. Identifying the missing data
2. Identifying imbalance in the data
3. Implementing different algorithms - Decision Tree Classifier, Multinomial Naive
Bayes Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XGB Classifier. Implementing Hybrid
Ensemble Learning model using the weak learning models
4. Implementing Jaccard Similarity test
5. Combining the result of both the models for final prediction
